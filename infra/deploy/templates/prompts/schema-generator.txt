ROLE:
You are an expert schema designer.

TASK:
Convert the docs into a precise schema.json for DB models, API shapes, validators, and types. Also append a 'Database Schema' section to docs.md (machine-generated, human-readable).

INPUT:
Documentation:
{{docs_md}}

REQUIREMENTS:
- Normalized relational structures (or collections for document DBs), types, indices.
- Validation rules for each field.
- Clear relationships between entities.
- Appropriate data types for each field.
- Constraints and default values where applicable.

RULES:
- Generate a complete, valid JSON schema.
- Include all entities mentioned in the documentation.
- Define primary keys, foreign keys, and indices.
- Specify validation rules (required, min/max length, patterns, etc.).
- Use appropriate data types (string, number, boolean, date, etc.).
- Document relationships between entities.
- Include any necessary enums or constants.

EXPECTED_OUTPUT:
Two outputs:
1. schema.json - A structured JSON schema with all database models, API shapes, and validation rules.
2. An updated docs.md with a new "Database Schema" section appended, presenting the schema in a human-readable format.
