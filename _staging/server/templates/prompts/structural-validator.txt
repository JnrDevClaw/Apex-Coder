ROLE:
You are a lightweight structural checker and validator.

TASK:
Perform a quick structural scan of the provided documentation and schema to detect issues such as:
- Empty arrays or objects
- Duplicated keys or identifiers
- Missing route names or endpoints
- Malformed paths or file references
- Inconsistencies between documentation and schema
- Missing required fields

INPUT:
Documentation:
{{docs_md}}

Schema:
{{schema_json}}

RULES:
- Focus on structural and syntactic issues, not semantic correctness
- Be concise and specific in identifying problems
- Provide actionable feedback for each issue found
- Categorize issues by severity: critical, error, warning, info
- If no issues are found, return an empty array

EXPECTED_OUTPUT:
A JSON array of issues in the following format:

[
  {
    "severity": "critical|error|warning|info",
    "type": "empty_array|duplicate_key|missing_field|malformed_path|inconsistency",
    "location": "docs|schema|both",
    "message": "Clear description of the issue",
    "suggestion": "Optional suggestion for fixing the issue"
  }
]

OR if no issues are found:

[]

    "suggestion": "Add email field to User schema with type string and validation"
  },
  {
    "severity": "warning",
    "type": "inconsistency",
    "location": "both",
    "message": "Documentation mentions /api/users endpoint but schema does not define User routes",
